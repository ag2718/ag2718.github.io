I'm Aarush, a current student at MIT where I'm completing my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, Physics, along with an M.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering. My current research focus is optimizing neural network inference on FPGAs: as part of the [MIT-CERN Particle Physics Collaboration](https://web.mit.edu/lns/research/ppc.html) under Philip Harris, I'm working on low-latency (<10 ns) and resource-efficient inference for tiny neural networks processing high-throughput data streams at the Large Hadron Collider.

I'm currently working on distributed systems at [Stripe](https://stripe.com). In the past, I've worked on ML research and engineering at [Emerald Innovations](https://emeraldinno.com) and [Naska.AI](https://naska.ai), been an autonomy engineer on [MIT Arcturus Robotics](https://arcturus.mit.edu). My interests span AI research, systems and software engineering, and hardware engineering (digital design).
